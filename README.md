#Simple histogram

I learned how to use histograms to store and evaluate information to solve
algorithms recently. This small project uses the Raphael (vector graphics library)
and the gRaphael (charting library) to draw a histogram of character counts based
on user input via web page prompt.

From this project, I learned that in a typical block of text, the space character
appears in higher frequency than any other character.

###Instructions

Visit https://rodocite.github.io/simple-histogram to test the application.

####Issues

- Space and new lines need labels.
- Formatting issue when too many unique characters are used.
- Blank page when no characters are entered.
