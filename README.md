#Simple histogram

I learned recently that histograms can be used to store and evaluate information.
to solve algorithms. This small project uses the Raphael (vector graphics library)
and the gRaphael (charting library) to draw a histogram of character counts based
on user input via web page prompt.

From this project, I learned that in a typical block of text, the space character
appears in higher frequency than any other character.

###Instructions

1. Download the files and store locally on a folder
2. Run index.html
3. Input your text in the pop-up prompt.
4. A histogram of unique characters will be rendered on the page.

####Issues

- Space and new lines need labels.
